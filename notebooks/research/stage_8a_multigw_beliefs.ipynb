    "## Why Multi-GW Rollup?\n",
    "\n",
    "Single-GW decisions (captaincy, transfer-IN) showed that availability adjustment (`p_play × mu_points`) does **not** improve ranking outcomes. The top-ranked players by `mu_points` are already nailed-on starters, so multiplying by `p_play ≈ 0.95` just dampens their scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what happens over **multiple gameweeks**?\n",
    "\n",
    "If a player has `p_play = 0.90` in each GW, over 5 GWs their cumulative probability of playing all matches is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(\\text{plays all 5}) = 0.90^5 = 0.59$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This suggests that **availability risk compounds over time**. A player who is slightly rotation-prone may miss 1-2 GWs in a 5-GW window, significantly reducing their actual returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stage 8a computes multi-GW belief rollups to test whether availability adjustment becomes valuable over longer horizons.\n",

    "## Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **cum_play_prob decays rapidly**: The average probability of playing all GWs drops to ~17-30% even over short horizons. This is because the player pool includes many rotation-prone players.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **cum_ev < cum_mu_points**: The availability-adjusted expected value is always lower than the raw sum, reflecting the risk of missing games.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **EV ratio decreases with horizon**: Over longer horizons, a larger fraction of expected value is \"lost\" to availability risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What This Enables\n",
    "\n",
    "Stage 8b can now evaluate:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Does ranking players by `cum_ev` outperform ranking by `cum_mu_points` over multi-GW horizons?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "If availability compounds meaningfully, we expect `cum_ev` to produce better rankings for hold-length decisions (e.g., \"which player should I transfer in and keep for 5 GWs?\").\n",
    "\n",
    "### Caveats\n",
    "\n",
    "- Beliefs are treated as independent across GWs (no autocorrelation)\n",
    "- No decay or weighting applied\n",
    "- Squad constraints not considered\n",
    "\n",
    "This stage is a pure belief transformation. Evaluation happens in Stage 8b."
